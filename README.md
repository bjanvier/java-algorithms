## Permutations algorithm using Recursion

The permutation algorithm, also commonly so-called Heap Algorithm, is a simple programming solving problem that rearranges characters inside a given string input. Every time there is a swap between two or more characters, there is also a new string input generated.

In the class `Permutations`, the recurcive function `getInput` will return an array list of all the combinations possible that can derive from the `input` argument. For instance, "Janvier" will return 5040 new unique inputs
